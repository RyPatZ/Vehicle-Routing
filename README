Vehicle Routing
Every day, a delivery company needs to deliver goods to many different customers. The deliveries are achieved by
dispatching a fleet of vehicles from a centralised storage warehouse. The goal of this problem is to design a route for
each vehicle so that all of the customers are served by exactly one vehicle and the travel distance of the vehicles is
minimised. Additional problem complexity comes from the fact that the vehicles have a fixed storage capacity and
the customers have different demands.
